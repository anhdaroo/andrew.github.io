            Hello! My name is Andrew Nguyen. I was born on January 28, 1998 in Fountain Valley, CA. I was born and raised Southern California.

            In 2016, I left Orange County to attend college at the University of California, Merced to study Computer Science & Engineering. I completed my studies to receive my Bachelor's of Science degree on December 20, 2020.

            <br><br>

            In my freetime I deeply enjoy learning about blockchain technology and playing tennis. I'm also working on starting a YouTube channel to spread awareness about crypto, finance, and entrepreneurship. 

            <br><br>
            Currently, I am back in Orange County working on projects to refine my coding skills and knowledge.

            <br><br>
            I am seeking opportunities to advance my career as a software engineer in either app development,
            web development, or other entry level positions in software. I appreciate you for taking the time to get to know me :D.
